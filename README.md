# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. I am using these problems to brush up on my C knowledge.
 

## Installation

Clone this repository locally

## Usage

Clone this repo, navigate to the day you wish to run, and run the solution to any day by running:
```bash
./part1 
#or 
./part2
```
Note: I have not included my puzzle input in each data.txt file. If you wish to run them yourself, you will need to get your own input at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
